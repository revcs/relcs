[ST_MOB4]
~w~Hello.

~w~Toni. It's me, Sal.

[STMOB4B]
~w~I can smell those Forellis behind all this shit I'm in.

[STMOB4C]

[STMOB4D]

[SAL1_M1:SAL1]
~w~Salvatore wants to talk.

[SAL1_M2:SAL1]
~w~I'm not playing Salvatore's game.

[SAL1_M3:SAL1]
~w~Thanks for the donation, kid... see you around.

[SAL1_M5:SAL1]
~w~Hey!

[SAL1_D1:SAL1]
~w~Hey! Strike breaker!

[SAL1_D2:SAL1]
~w~Get him!

[SAL1_D3:SAL1]
~w~There he is!

[SAL1_D4:SAL1]
~w~He's over there!

[SAL1_E1:SAL1]
~w~Escape from the docks!

[SAL1_A1:SAL1]
~w~Meet the Union boss, Jane Hopper, at ~y~Portland Docks.

[THEO_01:SAL1]
Eh, boss, you okay?

[THEO_02:SAL1]
Do I look okay?

[THEO_03:SAL1]
No.

[THEO_04:SAL1]
Then what are you? A fuckin' moron?

[THEO_05:SAL1]
You're always saying the obvious.

[THEO_06:SAL1]
I can't believe I'm surrounded by people like you.

[THEO_07:SAL1]
Sorry.

[THEO_08:SAL1]
Listen, I'm sorry. Toni, you're one of my most trusted allies.

[THEO_09:SAL1]
After what you did, you're like a son to me - better than my son,

[THEO_10:SAL1]
better than any son.

[THEO_11:SAL1]
Your mother's a lucky woman.

[THEO_12:SAL1]
So I hear.

[THEO_13:SAL1]
Anthony, its over for guys like us.

[THEO_14:SAL1]
We're dinosaurs. Or dodos. Or dildos. Or something.

[THEO_15:SAL1]
I tell you, even in my own family I feel like Jesus surrounded by twelve Judases.

[THEO_16:SAL1]
I mean, listen to this;

[THEO_17:SAL1]
I got a union boss - a broad no less - that I need to do me a favor,

[THEO_18:SAL1]
and she asks me for money?

[THEO_19:SAL1]
All I wanted was 24 hour access to the docks, while the strike was going on,

[THEO_20:SAL1]
strikes that I helped organize, so my boys could offload some drugs,

[THEO_21:SAL1]
and now I get this horse shit!

[THEO_22:SAL1]
I mean these are people that I personally fought for,

[THEO_23:SAL1]
people I've killed for, honest people.

[THEO_26:SAL1]
It's a disgrace. We're finished, men of honor like you and me.

[THEO_27:SAL1]
Listen, Toni, I want you to take something to her.

[THEO_28:SAL1]
You're gonna take this crap off a broad?

[THEO_29:SAL1]
For now what choice do I have?

[THEO_30:SAL1]
Look, go down there, pay her off - and tell her I'd like to have a word with her.

[THEO_31:SAL1]
Go.

[THEO_24:SAL1]
- And this is how they repay me? ~n~ - It's insulting.

[MAC1_BC:MAC1]
~w~Is this how you spend your time?

[MAC1_BD:MAC1]
~w~Sneaking around in the woods taking pictures of men?

[MAC1_BE:MAC1]
~w~What's wrong with you Antonio? You shame me!

[MAC1_BF:MAC1]
~w~But!

[MAC1_BG:MAC1]
~w~And, diaper or no diaper, he's still a better man than you!

[MAC1_B8:MAC1]
~w~Now head outside.

~w~Tail ~r~Casa~w~, but don't get too close.

[MAC1_C7:MAC1]

~w~There's no 'Ma' here for you no more, you coward!

[MAC2_AC:MAC2]
~w~You can't fool me... I know why you don't move back in here.

[MAC2_AD:MAC2]
~w~You're running scared of some Triads!

[MAC2_AE:MAC2]
~w~Your father, God rest his soul, wouldn't let no one run him out of his own home.

[MAC2_AF:MAC2]
~w~But Ma!

[MAC2_AG:MAC2]
~w~But unlike you, your father wasn't yellow!

[MAC2_AH:MAC2]
~w~Until the Triads show you some respect, you're no son of mine!

[MAC2_AI:MAC2]
~w~A daughter maybe, but not a son.

[MAC2_B1:MAC2]
~w~Show Ma you're not scared of the Triads. Deal with the ~r~two Triad gangs~w~ in Chinatown!

[MAC2_I1:MAC2]
~w~A Triad gang leader's in that bulletproof ~r~fish van.~w~ Ram him off the road!

[MAC2_I2:MAC2]
~w~The ~r~van's ~w~running - and shedding its load! Watch out!

[MAC2_I3:MAC2]
~w~They're getting out! Take down the ~r~Triad ~w~scum!

[MAC2_I4:MAC2]
~w~You've been spotted! Waste all the ~r~Triad gang members!

[MAC2_I5:MAC2]
~w~You're in ~r~Triad~w~ territory. Be careful!

[MAC2_I6:MAC2]
~w~One down, one more to go. Take out the other ~r~gang!

[MAC2_BA:MAC2]

~w~Ma? I'm back...

[MAC3_A1:MAC3]
~w~Look at you! You look so thin!

[MAC3_A2:MAC3]
~w~If you were still living here, with your mother, like a son should, you'd be eating right!

[MAC3_A3:MAC3]
~w~And look at those cars you drive!

[MAC3_A4:MAC3]
~w~You shame me, Antonio, really you do.

[MAC3_A5:MAC3]
~w~People will think I brought you up wrong!

[MAC3_A6:MAC3]
~w~What can I do Ma? You know I'd do anything for you.

[MAC3_A7:MAC3]
~w~That Sucho boy's racing downtown today.

[MAC3_A8:MAC3]
~w~If only you were more like him!

[MAC3_A9:MAC3]
~w~He treats his mother with real respect.

[MAC3_AA:MAC3]
~w~Of course, if your father was here, he'd win the race,

[MAC3_AB:MAC3]
~w~AND take the smug grin off that Sucho boy's face!

[MAC3_AC:MAC3]
~w~Yeah, he'd make him eat lead!

[MAC3_AD:MAC3]
~w~Ah! Your father was a real man! Big balls!

[MAC3_B0:MAC3]
~w~Prove you're more than a match for Sucho. Win the race, then take him out.

[MAC3_C0:MAC3]
~w~You beat ~r~Sucho~w~, now take him out!

~w~You shame your Sicilian roots!

[MAC4_A3:MAC4]
~w~After you took that photo of Casa, he stopped paying his protection money.

[MAC4_A4:MAC4]
~w~And what are you doing about it?

[MAC4_A5:MAC4]
~w~NOTHING!

[MAC4_A6:MAC4]
~w~Your father would have turned him into meatballs by now!

[MAC4_A8:MAC4]
~w~but it takes guts to snub a Cipriani!

[MAC4_A9:MAC4]
~w~I only wish you had his guts!

[MAC4_AA:MAC4]
~w~You wish I had Casa's guts?

[MAC4_AB:MAC4]
~w~Okay, Ma! You asked for 'em!

[MAC4_B:MAC4]

~w~Cat got your tongue?

[MAC4_B3:MAC4]
~w~You and me are gonna talk, Casa...

[MAC4_B4:MAC4]
~w~Just somewhere more private.

[MAC4_C:MAC4]
~w~Don't let ~r~Casa~w~ get out alive.

[MAC4_C1:MAC4]
~w~I'll pay the protection money, Toni! I swear I will!

[MAC4_C2:MAC4]
~w~Aw! Come on, Toni! I'll give you anything you want!

~w~Does your Ma still like a spicy sausage?

[MAC4_F5:MAC4]
I can get her some, no problem!

[MAC4_G0:MAC4]
~w~So... erm... what do you wanna talk about, Toni?

[MAC4_G1:MAC4]
~w~Is it the protection money?

[MAC4_G2:MAC4]
~w~It is isn't it?

[MAC4_G3:MAC4]
~w~...Toni?

[MAC4_G4:MAC4]
~w~We can talk about this. Right, Toni?

[MAC4_G6:MAC4]
~w~People just don't talk enough these days, Toni.

[MAC4_G7:MAC4]
~w~Stand there and shut your yap, Casa.

[MAC4_G8:MAC4]
~w~Okay Toni! But I... I... don't feel comfortable.

[MAC4_G9:MAC4]
~w~Hey! Easy with that Toni! It's the on switch for the...

[MAC4_GA:MAC4]
~w~AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHH!

~w~There's loads of meat back here!

[MAC4_I4:MAC4]
~w~...Mmmm! Tasty! Okay, I'll take them.

[MAC4_I6:MAC4]
~w~If he finds out about this, he'll go crazy!

[MAC4_I7:MAC4]
~w~Then I'd be screwed!

[MAC4_X0:MAC4]
~r~That was too quick and painless to be a Sicilian hit!

[MAC4_X1:MAC4]
~r~You were supposed to deliver the van!

[MAC4_X2:MAC4]
~r~You lost Casa!

[MAC4_E2:MAC4]
~w~Don't leave the ~y~sawmill!

[MAC4_I5:MAC4]
~w~It's a good thing Casa ain't here.

So listen, Toni, I know you did a good thing for us,

[HOMS_04:VIC1]
so I want you to take it easy for a while, huh?

[HOMS_05:VIC1]
Vincenzo will look after you.

[HOMS_06:VIC1]
You need some money, ask him.

[HOMS_07:VIC1]
You need a job - Lucky'll take care of you.

[HOMS_08:VIC1]
What more could a family guy ask for?

[HOMS_09:VIC1]
Even my son don't got it so good.

[HOMS_10:VIC1]
But, Mr. Leone, I thought we got history,

[HOMS_11:VIC1]
I mean I've done a lot for this family.

[HOMS_12:VIC1]
And now, you're expecting me to take orders from this... this... this...

[HOMS_13:VIC1]
Well it just doesn't seem... right.

[HOMS_14:VIC1]
Toni, I know what you did, and no one is more grateful than me, honestly,

[HOMS_15:VIC1]
but the idea that you walk in here

[HOMS_16:VIC1]
and start to question my leadership right away is, quite frankly,

[HOMS_17:VIC1]
out of order. Capiche?

[HOMS_18:VIC1]
I understand, boss.

[HOMS_19:VIC1]
So, when you need something, give Vincenzo a call down at Atlantic Quay.

[HOMS_20:VIC1]
He'll take care of you. Won't you, Lucky?

[HOMS_21:VIC1]
Of course, boss. Anything you say.

Tell you what; we can go there now.

Of course, how silly of me - I just love all the romance languages.

[CAMP_04:DONS3]
My God, this is good.

[CAMP_05:DONS3]
It tastes just like chicken, but some how, more, err, sentient.

I already ate, thanks.

Too bad. It's fantastic.

I have some more delicacies about to be served...

[CAMP_10:DONS3]
the liberals would have a field day, of course,

Sophistication and democracy have always been such uneasy bedfellows.

[CAMP_13:DONS3]
Listen, Don, we need to win this election.

Okay, we need to make sure that there's no skeletons in the closet,

how do we take care of this O'Donovan guy who is covering for...

[CAMP_19:DONS3]
standing in for the Forelli's?

[CAMP_20:DONS3]
The guy has a lot of people canvassing for him,

[CAMP_21:DONS3]
all kinds of deluded 'people' people, if you know what I mean.

[CAMP_22:DONS3]
I think we need to have their faith in democracy shaken, if you understand me.

[CAMP_23:DONS3]
What you mean is that I gotta go beat the crap out of them?

[CAMP_24:DONS3]
Oh, your passion, Antonio, it's it's... magnificent.

That's bad, right?

[DS4_AF:DONS4]
Well, we certainly can't trust them.

[DS4_AG:DONS4]
No, it's best if they all have a MAJOR malfunction, if you catch my drift.

Now, I'm no Democrat, but even I draw the line at vote rigging.

[ELEC_04:DONS7]
You got no more links to organized crime.

[ELEC_05:DONS7]
You're whiter than white. You could be the pope.

[ELEC_07:DONS7]
Although no links can be proved between Donald Love

[ELEC_08:DONS7]
and Liberty City's organized crime,

[ELEC_09:DONS7]
it seems his friendship with mobsters including Toni Cipriani,

[ELEC_11:DONS7]
have counted heavily against him in voters' eyes.

[ELEC_12:DONS7]
The past few hours have seen his popularity plummet.

[ELEC_13:DONS7]
He is deemed, it seems, unfit for office...

[ELEC_14:DONS7]
Unfit! Because of you...

[ELEC_15:DONS7]
Yeah. And it's all your fault.

Even the Elevator Bridge linking Staunton Island to Shoreside Vale has reopened for business.

[RMN_AE:DONS7]
Militant strikers have finally dropped their placards and taken up their usual posts of employment

[RMN_AF:DONS7]
after the freshly inaugurated Mayor O'Donovan made them this promise at a local rally.

[RMN_AG:DONS7]
As your mayor I can guarantee there will ALWAYS be a ferry service in Liberty City.

[RMN_AH:DONS7]
But, some may find his promise has a somewhat hollow ring,

~w~Yes sir, a fortune...

[DONH1EE:DONH1]
~w~Even Avery would be proud.

[DONH1GA:DONH1]
~w~There he is!

[DONH1GB:DONH1]
~w~Kill him Toni!

[DONH1GC:DONH1]
~w~I need those plans!

[DONH1HA:DONH1]
~w~Please, Toni... he's getting away!

[DONH1IA:DONH1]
~w~Oh, capital, Toni! ...quite literally!

[DONH1IB:DONH1]
~w~Now lets get this back to the safety of my, erm, 'place of abode'.

[DONH1O0:DONH1]
~w~Take Donald Love to the ~y~Airport.

[DONH1O1:DONH1]
~w~Kill ~r~Avery Carrington~w~ and get his plans!

[DONH1O2:DONH1]
~r~Avery~w~ is making a run for it! Stop him!

~r~Avery~w~ has got another ride. Don't let him get away!

[DONH1O4:DONH1]
~r~Avery~w~ is making a run for it! Get him!

[DONH1O5:DONH1]

~w~They're on to you! ~r~Avery's~w~ making a run for it! Kill him!

[DONH1OB:DONH1]
~w~You need a vehicle.

[DONH1OC:DONH1]
~w~Don't lose ~b~Donald!

[DONH1OD:DONH1]
~w~Be careful! The plans will be lost if ~r~Avery's car~w~ is destroyed while he's in it!

[DONH1OE:DONH1]
~r~Avery Carrington~w~ is escaping. Get after him!

[DONH1F0:DONH1]
~r~The plans were destroyed!

[DONH1F1:DONH1]
~r~Avery Carrington escaped!

[DONH1F2:DONH1]
~r~Donald was killed!

[DONH1OF:DONH1]
~r~Avery Carrington~w~ is nearly at his destination. Stop him!

[DONH1O9:DONH1]
~w~Don't leave ~b~Donald~w~ behind! Those Colombians will kill him!

[DONH1FA:DONH1]
~w~Hmmm, Panlantic must have employed the Cartel to protect Avery.

[LAND_01:DONH1]
I know what you're thinking, Toni - how the mighty have fallen,

[LAND_02:DONH1]
but this is just a temporary blip, my man.

[LAND_03:DONH1]
Okay.

[LAND_04:DONH1]
Oh, don't be all touchy.

[LAND_05:DONH1]
I know I said some nasty things about this being your fault and all,

[LAND_06:DONH1]
but hubris is a nasty, nasty bedfellow - almost as nasty as termites.

[LAND_07:DONH1]
And trust me I've tried both recently.

[LAND_08:DONH1]
Wait, you and me... are on our way back!

[LAND_09:DONH1]
I never went away...

[LAND_10:DONH1]
We're in this together, amigo.

[LAND_11:DONH1]
No, we're not.

[LAND_12:DONH1]
Please!

[LAND_13:DONH1]
Please... please - forget about it, buddy.

[LAND_18:DONH1]
Come - I'll tell you about it on the drive.

[LAND_19:DONH1]
I hope you have your car. Mine's in the, err, shop... Yeah!

[LAND_16:DONH1]
- 10% of what? This? Oh you're too kind. ~n~ - Not of this... of something really big.

[LAND_14:DONH1]
- 'It's all your fault.' Pathetic. ~n~ - 10%?

Maybe tomorrow.

[DONP_09:DONH6]
Your message seemed kinda anxious.

[DONP_10:DONH6]
Anxious? I'm meditating. Anxious, moi?

[DONP_11:DONH6]
I'm at one with the universe. That's just impossible.

[DONP_12:DONH6]
Oh, shit, that's right.

[DONP_13:DONH6]
Um, there is a load of Colombians coming up here

[DONP_14:DONH6]
to potentially kill me if I don't keep my mouth shut and pay them all off.

[DONP_15:DONH6]
Oh! I guess that would explain all the Colombians hovering around outside.

[DONP_16:DONH6]
Oh shit! Please, Antonio, you have to get me out of here!

[DONP_17:DONH6]
I don't want to... Please! I don't wanna die! I don't...

[DONP_18:DONH6]
So much for being at one with the universe, huh?

Do you know what it is to live without love, Mr Toni?

[DEAD_05:TOSH1]
It is to live with hate...

[DEAD_06:TOSH1]
I'll take your word for it.

[DEAD_07:TOSH1]
It is my earnest wish to destroy a man, Mr. Cipriani.

[DEAD_08:TOSH1]
Destroy... not merely kill.

[DEAD_09:TOSH1]
I want him, and his whole organization, weakened and humiliated before he dies.

[DEAD_10:TOSH1]
I want him to suffer.

[DEAD_11:TOSH1]
Okay.

This man I want you to destroy is my husband: Kazuki Kasen.

Don't worry.

[DEAD_14:TOSH1]
For your services you will be handsomely rewarded.

[DEAD_15:TOSH1]
Well what if I say no?

[DEAD_16:TOSH1]
You won't... because while I merely want him dead, you need him dead.

[DEAD_17:TOSH1]
In truth, you have already dealt him a severe blow, Mr. Cipriani.

[DEAD_18:TOSH1]
However, he is taking delivery of more munitions today.
